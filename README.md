BigClockGit
===========

Remember the Win 7 desktop widgets? The clock? Use this very rudimentary Win 8 desktop program to show a digital clock on your desktop.

For now VS2012 C# .Net 4 WPF code only.

Instructions
------------

* Open solution in VS2012
* Right click solution in solution explorer, select properties, click configuration manager, set active solution configuration to Release
* Build
* Copy the files in the bin\Release-folder to another folder
* Navigate to the "another folder" above and start the BigClockGit.exe
* The big clock will initially be placed above the tray, move the clock to another location by dragging any part of any figure

If you want to exit, reset clock placement or remove the autostart at login do this:

* Locate the startflag-icon in the tray and click the icon, then click the button associated with the desired action
